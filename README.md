# TaskMe

I like to visualise and organise my tasks, so I decided I'm gonna make simple, minimalistic task manager. I think itâ€™s very good idea for a quick project and good starting point for my YouTube channel.

## Functionality

- add, rename, delete a folders (each folder can store it's own tasks)
- add, rename a task (with input element)
- move, delete a task (with drag and drop action)

## Tech

- Next.js
- Tailwindcss
- localStorage
- Context with reducer
